  <h1>How to Play</h1>
  <p>Playing the game is straightforward. Let's go through a few key points together.</p>

  <h2>The Story and the Challenges</h2>
  <p>You will need to read a short story (just a few sentences long) before you can control the cat. The story appears at the top of the interface. Press the &rarr; (right arrow key) on your keyboard to continue reading. <br /> When you come across a sentence that starts with "Challenge," you can press ENTER on your keyboard to start playing.</p>
  <p>There are five challenges in this game. You must complete the previous challenges before moving on to the next ones. In each challenge, you need to collect a certain number of specific blocks to win. Empty circles or squares indicate your goals, while solid circles and squares show the amount you have already collected.</p>

  <h2>Extend or Shorten the Cat</h2>
  <p>Use the ASDW keys on your keyboard to guide the cat in the desired direction. If the cat hits a colored dot, it will become longer.</p>
  <p>If the cat encounters a box with a black dot inside, it will become shorter. We&rsquo;ll refer to these boxes as "shorteners." However, a shortener will only shorten the cat if the cat's trunk matches the box's color and shape. The idea is that these boxes symbolize tunnels, and the cat will lose some segments after passing through one. (That might be a bit of a joke!)</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that the cat will lose only one block at a time when it passes through a tunnel or shortener.</p>

  <h2>End Game Conditions</h2>
  <p> The cat can die under three conditions: <br /> - First, if the cat crashes into a wall. <br /> - Second, if the cat runs into itself. <br /> - The third condition is rare: if the cat becomes too long and there&rsquo;s no room left on the board, it will die due to a lack of space.</p>

  <h2>Win Condition</h2>
  <p> There is only one way to win: you must meet all the goals set by a challenge.</p>
  <p>That&rsquo;s basically how the game works! Have fun exploring!</p>
